Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning,Physics ,https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00003,Optics (physics.optics); Machine Learning (cs.LG),,"Metamaterials with functional responses can exhibit varying properties under different conditions (e.g., wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation). This work addresses the rapid inverse design of such metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due to its intractability and non-unique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and non-interpretable deep-learning-based methods, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), a single-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a random forest-based ""design?response"" forward model, eliminating the need for a more complex ""response?design"" inverse model. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We validate RIGID on acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the genetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target satisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design under small data constraints.","Metamaterials with functional responses can exhibit varying properties under different conditions (e.g., wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation).

Internet of Harvester Nano Things: A Future Prospects,Electrical Engineering and Systems Science,https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00346,Signal Processing (eess.SP),Energy harvesting; WPT; IoNT; Nanodevices; Nanogenerators,"The advancements in nanotechnology, material science, and electrical engineering have shrunk the sizes of electronic devices down to the micro/nanoscale. This brings the opportunity of developing the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT). With nanodevices, numerous new possibilities emerge in the biomedical, military fields, and industrial products. However, a continuous energy supply is mandatory for these devices to work. At the micro/nanoscale, batteries cannot supply this demand due to size limitations and the limited energy contained in the batteries. Internet of Harvester Nano Things (IoHNT), a concept of Energy Harvesting (EH) integrated with wireless power transmission (WPT) techniques, converts the existing different energy sources into electrical energy and transmits to IoNT nodes. As IoHNTs are not directly attached to IoNTs, it gives flexibility in size. However, we define the size of IoHNTs as up to 10 cm. In this review, we comprehensively investigate the available energy sources and EH principles to wirelessly power IoNTs. We discuss the IoHNT principles, material selections, and state-of-the-art applications of each energy source for different sectoral applications. The different technologies of WPT and how communication is influenced by the incorporation of IoHNTs to power IoNTs are discussed with the future research directions. IoHNTs represent a shift in the nanodevice power supply, leading us towards a future where wireless technology is widespread. Hence, it will motivate researchers to envision and contribute to advancing the following power revolution in IoNT, providing unmatched simplicity and efficiency.","The advancements in nanotechnology, material science, and electrical engineering have shrunk the sizes of electronic devices down to the micro/nanoscale.

Hybrid physics-informed metabolic cybergenetics: process rates augmented with machine-learning surrogates informed by flux balance analysis,Electrical Engineering and Systems Science,https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00670,Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC),cybergenetics; metabolic engineering; machine learning; predictive control; estimation; optogenetics,"Metabolic cybergenetics is a promising concept that interfaces gene expression and cellular metabolism with computers for real-time dynamic metabolic control. The focus is on control at the transcriptional level, serving as a means to modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes. Recent strategies in this field have employed constraint-based dynamic models for process optimization, control, and estimation. However, this results in bilevel dynamic optimization problems, which pose considerable numerical and conceptual challenges. In this study, we present an alternative hybrid physics-informed dynamic modeling framework for metabolic cybergenetics, aimed at simplifying optimization, control, and estimation tasks. By utilizing machine-learning surrogates, our approach effectively embeds the physics of metabolic networks into the process rates of structurally simpler macro-kinetic models coupled with gene expression. These surrogates, informed by flux balance analysis, link the domains of manipulatable intracellular enzymes to metabolic exchange fluxes. This ensures that critical knowledge captured by the system's metabolic network is preserved. The resulting models can be integrated into metabolic cybergenetic schemes involving single-level optimizations. Additionally, the hybrid modeling approach maintains the number of system states at a necessary minimum, easing the burden of process monitoring and estimation. Our hybrid physics-informed metabolic cybergenetic framework is demonstrated using a computational case study on the optogenetically-assisted production of itaconate by Escherichia coli.","Metabolic cybergenetics is a promising concept that interfaces gene expression and cellular metabolism with computers for real-time dynamic metabolic control.

Needle Threading: Can LLMs Follow Threads through Near-Million-Scale Haystacks?,Computer Science,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05000, Computation and Language (cs.CL),,"As the context limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, the range of possible applications and downstream functions broadens. In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. We release our code and long-context experimental data.","As the context limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, the range of possible applications and downstream functions broadens.
