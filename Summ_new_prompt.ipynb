This work addresses the rapid inverse design of such metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due to its intractability and non-unique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and non-interpretable deep-learning-based methods, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), a single-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a random forest-based \"design?response\" forward model, eliminating the need for a more complex \"response?design\" inverse model. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We validate RIGID on acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the genetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target satisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design under small data constraints.\\nOne sentence summary:  Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning\\nPaper: Generative Inverse',\n",

Despite its simplicity, this family presents interesting and subtle problems, as the behavior of the cellular automaton completely depends on the structure of p. We show that every cellular automaton ? with a unique active transition p?AS is either idempotent or strictly almost equicontinuous, and we completely characterize each one of these situations in terms of p. In essence, the idempotence of ? depends on the existence of a certain subpattern of p with a translational symmetry.\\nOne sentence summary: \\xa0The title is a sentence summarizing the abstract of an article.',\n",

The focus is on control at the transcriptional level, serving as a means to modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes. Recent strategies in this field have employed constraint-based dynamic models for process optimization, control, and estimation. However, this results in bilevel dynamic optimization problems, which pose considerable numerical and conceptual challenges. In this study, we present an alternative hybrid physics-informed dynamic modeling framework for metabolic cybergenetics, aimed at simplifying optimization, control, and estimation tasks. By utilizing machine-learning surrogates, our approach effectively embeds the physics of metabolic networks into the process rates of structurally simpler macro-kinetic models coupled with gene expression. These surrogates, informed by flux balance analysis, link the domains of manipulatable intracellular enzymes to metabolic exchange fluxes. This ensures that critical knowledge captured by the system's metabolic network is preserved. The resulting models can be integrated into metabolic cybergenetic schemes involving single-level optimizations. Additionally, the hybrid modeling approach maintains the number of system states at a necessary minimum, easing the burden of process monitoring and estimation. Our hybrid physics-informed metabolic cybergenetic framework is demonstrated using a computational case study on the optogenetically-assisted production of itaconate by Escherichia coli.\\nOne sentence summary: \\xa0Hybrid physics-informed metabolic cybergenetics: process rates augmented with machine-learning surrogates informed by flux balance analysis\",\n",

In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. We release our code and long-context experimental data.\\nOne sentence summary: 1.
